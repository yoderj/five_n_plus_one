# five_n_plus_one
Explores Max Milker'ts 5n+1 problem, a variation on the famous 3n+1 problem.

This script explores the 5n+1 problem, first proposed by MSOE student
Max Milkert, to the best of my knowledge.

In terms of the code provided here, the theorem is that i(n) <= 7 for all
positive integers n.  This code was used to prove it numerically up
to n > 5_000_000_000.
